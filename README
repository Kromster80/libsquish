FIXED TABLES 
------------

This fork of the original library contains fixed solid color tables for 3 and
4 color blocks. The original tables did not factor in the up to 3% error allowed
by actual GPU BC1 decoding hardware, leading to noticeable artifacts on some textures.
More information is here: 
http://www.ludicon.com/castano/blog/2009/03/gpu-dxt-decompression/

To use the original tables, set SQUISH_USE_ORIGINAL_TABLES to 1 in singlecolourfit.cpp.

Average across 101 test textures:

Original/bad tables:
Ideal BC1 PSNR: 36.504513 dB, std dev: 7.569236
NVidia BC1 PSNR: 36.391151 dB, std dev: 7.389989

Fixed (this fork):
Ideal BC1 PSNR: 36.498199 dB, std dev: 7.555960
NVidia BC1 PSNR: 36.462097 dB, std dev: 7.475064

This is across 101 textures. Some textures are impacted more than others. One example (a grayscale texture):

Original:
Ideal BC1 PSNR: 46.656 dB
NVidia BC1 PSNR: 43.203 dB

Fixed:
Ideal BC1 PSNR: 46.625 dB
NVidia BC1 PSNR: 45.410 dB

BUILDING AND INSTALLING THE LIBRARY
-----------------------------------

If you are using Visual Studio 2003 or above under Windows then load the Visual
Studio 2003 project in the vs7 folder. By default, the library is built using
SSE2 optimisations. To change this either change or remove the SQUISH_USE_SSE=2
from the preprocessor symbols.

If you are using a Mac then load the Xcode 2.2 project in the distribution. By
default, the library is built using Altivec optimisations. To change this
either change or remove SQUISH_USE_ALTIVEC=1 from the preprocessor symbols. I
guess I'll have to think about changing this for the new Intel Macs that are
rolling out...

If you are using unix then first edit the config file in the base directory of
the distribution, enabling Altivec or SSE with the USE_ALTIVEC or USE_SSE
variables, and editing the optimisation flags passed to the C++ compiler if
necessary. Then make can be used to build the library, and make install (from
the superuser account) can be used to install (into /usr/local by default).
